My Repository: https://github.com/laslauren/Lauren_Sargent_las20d_GitHub-Basics 
I learned about the workspace of GitHub and the basics. I understand the basics and functions of everything, and just need more experience with the interface itself to familiarize myself with it. 
I am sure as I progress in my usage I will come across features I do not understand, but for now everything I have seen I understand.
