### Main Thing I Learned:
+ Currently I have no questions, just need some more time and practice getting used to Git.
+ I've used __certain aspects__ of GitHub before, but never really used Git. 
+ Mained thing I learned was how to commit to GitHub from Git by cloning a repository and committing from Git.
+ I was able to make a commit on a markdown file from Git in my personal repository by adding a line in the file.

+ Other terminology in GitHub, such as forks and issues.
