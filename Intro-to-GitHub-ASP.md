<u><p align=center>Intro to Github</p></u>

####Repository

The link to my repository is: `https://github.com/asp19e/ISC_5935_Intro_to_GitHub.git`.

####Main Things I've Learned

I learned how to properly authenticate for doing things in Git that I had not learned (or possibly forgot) in the last time I used Git and SourceTree. Basically, I mostly used Git in a GUI setting where things were more automated so I was unused to the command-line setting.

####Other Things I've Learned

This assignment served as a refresher to using Git, so all that I had forgotten in using Git previously came back into memory (including some of the Git concepts I never had to use).
